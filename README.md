### Xignite Ruby

This gem relies on the system running it to set up XIGNITE_USERNAME environment variable.

Xignite is a Ruby client library for the [Xignite Web Services API](http://xignite.com)

This gem only supports a subset of Xignite's Web Services. **Currently Supported** are all operations under:

  * [Currencies](http://www.xignite.com/xCurrencies.asmx)
  * [Metals](http://www.xignite.com/xMetals.asmx)

## Installation ##

    gem install xignite
    require 'xignite'

or with Bundler, simply add to your Gemfile:

    gem 'xignite'

## Basic Usage ##

*Xignite Ruby* provides a rubyist's interface to the Xignite API. It constructs a GET or POST request for you, and then parses the response into Array and Hash-like Ruby objects. Reference the Xignite documentation for required parameters and options, then call the appropriate Web Service in one of two ways:


    # The following two statements do the same thing
    response = Xignite::Metals.get_last_real_time_metal_quote(
      'Type' => 'XAU', 'Currency' => 'USD'
    )

    response = Xignite::Metals::GetLastRealTimeMetalQuote(
      'Type' => 'XAU', 'Currency' => 'USD'
    )

The response is a `Xignite::Metals::GetLastRealTimeMetalQuote` object:

    #<Xignite::Metals::GetLastRealTimeMetalQuote:0x007fbbc3a648f8
      @metal_quote={
        "outcome"=>"Success",
        "identity"=>"Request",
        "delay"=>0.006,
        "symbol"=>"XAUUSDO",
        "type"=>"XAU",
        "currency"=>"USD",
        "date"=>#<Date: 2011-12-09 (4911809/2,0,2299161)>,
        "time"=>2011-12-09 22:59:52 UTC,
        "rate"=>1711.42498779,
        "bid"=>1710.69995117,
        "bid_time"=>2011-12-09 22:59:52 UTC,
        "ask"=>1712.15002441,
        "ask_time"=>2011-12-09 22:59:52 UTC
      }>

Numeric values are automatically converted to `Float` objects

    response.metal_quote['ask']
    # => 1712.15002441

Times are automatically converted into `DateTime` objects with the appropriate time zone (if known)

    response.metal_quote['time']
    # => 2011-12-09 22:59:52 UTC

Dates are automatically converted into `Date` objects

    response.metal_quote['date']
    # => #<Date: 2011-12-09 (4911809/2,0,2299161)>

## Configuration ##

    Xignite.configure do |config|

      # Configure which HTTP method is used to contact the Xignite service
      # Default: :get, Possible values: [ :get, :post ]
      config.request_method = :get

      # Configure the endpoint hostname
      # Default: www.xignite.com
      config.endpoint = Xignite::URL

      # Use HTTPS
      # Default: false
      config.https = true

      # Set your Xignite username. This automatically adds a 'Header_Username' parameter to all requests as required.
      # Default: nil
      config.username = 'goldbug'
    end
